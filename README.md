Computer Science Project developed for A2 Level Computer Science Certification - A procedural generated maze based on cellular automata algorithm
This was the code and assets used that comprised my final project in college.
This is a simple maze game where you have to traverse one end of the map to the other, with the route being procedural based on a seed that could
be added in by the player or randomly generated by the program.
The project is not fully fufilled and just demonstrates an implementation of the algorthim concept.
